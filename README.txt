**Daily Challenge for Juniors:**  
**Today’s task: Build your personal website.**

**Rules:**  
1. The code must be hosted on GitHub.  
2. Set up automatic deployment after every commit.  
3. Use a custom domain.  
4. No website builders like Wix, Squarespace, etc.  
5. No static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, etc.  
6. The site must look good on mobile, desktop, and all browsers.  
7. HTTPS only.  
8. Include favicon, title, meta tags, etc.  
9. Create a 404 error page.  
10. Ensure accessibility for people with disabilities (e.g., alt text for images, good contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support).  
11. Write a clean README that explains the project.  
12. Test your site with tools like Google Lighthouse or GTmetrix to ensure good performance. Compress images, use modern formats (WebP/AVIF), and avoid loading unnecessarily heavy files.  
13. Add a basic (free) analytics tool to track where visitors come from.

**Content:**  
Anything you want, but think of it as a personal resume, with at least links to your GitHub and Twitter.

**Additional Notes:**  
- This challenge is suitable for non-juniors too—building a personal brand is essential.  
- Share your link for feedback!  
- A personal domain costs about $10/year. Everything else should ideally be free (most cloud providers offer free tiers).  
- Don’t go overboard with animations or fancy visuals. Simple is better.  
- You don’t need JavaScript frameworks like React/Vue or CSS libraries like Tailwind, but feel free to use them if you want to learn.  

**For those stuck in “analysis paralysis”:**  
If you need a starting point, consider using **AWS Amplify**.  

**Bonus Tips:**  
- Use proper headings (h1, h2…), accurate title tags, and friendly URLs if you’re creating multiple pages.  
- For extra points, add a contact form integrated with a free service like Formspree or a simple Lambda function.
